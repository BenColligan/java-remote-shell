# java-remote-shell
This program was my second year project for my module Systems Software - it is a remotely accessible shell programming in Java using Maven and developing within the NetBeans IDE.

This program was worked on with another partner although due to time constraints all the programing is done by me whilst my partner focused on completing documentation needed for the coursework submission - user manual, reference manual and demonstration video etc.
